### Description
The City Builder Simulation is a dynamic application designed to model urban development and management. Players can construct and manage various aspects of a virtual city, including buildings, utilities, transportation, and citizen services. The simulation incorporates various design patterns to ensure scalability, maintainability, and flexibility, creating a robust experience for users.

### Features
- **Urban Development**: Manage the growth of a city while balancing resources and citizen satisfaction.
- **Building Creation**: Use the Prototype and Factory Method patterns to create diverse building types quickly.
- **Citizen Management**: Create customizable citizens using the Builder pattern.
- **Resource Management**: Monitor and utilize resources through the State and Mediator patterns.
- **Dynamic State Management**: Track building states (under construction, operational) to reflect real-world scenarios.

### Design Patterns Used
- **Memento**: Stores previous states of the government, such as taxes and buildings.
- **Prototype**: For cloning buildings, allowing quick duplication of complex structures.
- **Decorator**: Adds additional features to buildings, such as boreholes and solar panels.
- **Composite**: Manages apartment buildings by grouping individual units into a single entity.
- **Iterator**: Traverses buildings and citizens efficiently.
- **Command**: Handles actions like collecting taxes and moving citizens.
- **Builder**: Creates customized citizens (e.g., children and adults) with specific attributes.
- **Factory Method**: Used for creating buildings with standard procedures.
- **State**: Manages different states of buildings (e.g., under construction, operational).
